# BraiNet for CSE535
The project is to read brain signal from https://physionet.org/pn4/eegmmidb/ as a biometric information for user authentication.
The main idea is to use machine learning algorithm to build a model against brain signal and to classify and recognize the new
input signal

This repository is consist of 2 major parts, a android app as a client program and server-side program written in PHP and python.
They are under Project folder and server folder respectively.

## Requirement
* Android SDK for android app compilation
* Apache server with php module to host file uploading and downloading services in server/test_UploadToServer.php and server/train_UploadToServer.php
* python libraries are list as follows
  * numpy and scipy for FFT functionality
  * sciket-learn for machine learning algorithm
  * pyedflib to read

## Note
1. After installing the Android client app, all EDF files must be manually put in this folder `Internal_Srorage/Android/data/PROJECT_DATA/` with the original directory structure. For example, the S001 folder structure must
be kept to make the app able to find the edf file.
2. `train_temp` and `test_temp` folder needs to be created manually along with server-side problems, which are those php and python files.
